# word-replacement-program
I watched a few videos and saw how to create a word-replacement-program. There are a few steps in making it:

1. I printed the statement i wanted the user to replace or accept, then i asked the user if they want to accept the statement or replace a word; To accept statement type 'a', To replace word type 'b'.
2. Then i made a variable like 'user' for the user to type if they want to replace or accept using the input() method 
3. I used an if statement for if the the user type 'a', the statement should be accepted: print('I am user') 
4. Then i made an elif statement for if the user type 'b'.Then i made a variable for "i am user" then i made another variable with the input() method for the user to choose the word they want to replace. Then i made another variable for the word replacement with the input() method.
5. Then i used the replace() method for the two variables(word_to_replace and word replacement).
6. After that i made an elif statement for if; word_to_replace not in statement: print("   unknown word,", statement, "does not include" word_to_replace).
7. I also added some spacing(print()) so the output will be neat
